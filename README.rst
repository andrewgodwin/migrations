migrations
==========

This is an *unstable*, *probably non-functional* work-in-progress migrations application for Django, with the eventual goal of replacing South and potentially becoming django.contrib.migrations.

Code in here is subject to change without notice, and is public only so it can be looked through and argued over - it's not yet intended to be runnable, and when it is it will require the latest development version of Django.
